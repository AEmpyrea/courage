    <h1>The Removal of the Headphone Jack from Apple</h1>
    <h3>Why?</h3>
    <p>Apple removed the headphone jack from the iPhone 7, to prepare for the launch of the iPhone X. Android competitors have been releasing devices with larger screens that often reach the top, left, and right bezels. </p>
    <p>However, they were having trouble shrinking the bottom bezel since that's where the display panels typically house their controller. </p>
    <p>If Apple would try to compete with their own edge to edge display, they would have to figure out how to shrink the bottom bezel. Eventually, their engineers found a solution- by utilizing an OLED panel's flexible properties, they would fold its controller behind the display, freeing up space at the bottom for a thin bezel. </p>
    <p>The only downside was the headphone jack needed to removed to make space for the display's controller. This technology would be used in the iPhone X, but the product's release was still a couple years away, in the meantime, Apple would still release the iPhone 7. Sicne they knew the headphone jack would be removed on the iPhone X, they considered removing it early on the iPhone 7. </p>
    <p>The benefit for the users would be improved water resistance, since the headphone jack was the easiest way for liquid to enter the phone. </p>
    <p>There was also a hidden benefit for Apple: they would be releasing the wireless headphones called 'AirPods' alongside the iPhone 7. If the phone had no headphone jack, demand for wireless headphones would increase. And in 2016, there was virtually no true wireless earbuds on the market, which created a huge opportunity for Apple to earn more money. </p>
    <p>Shifting the headpnone jack removal to the iPhone 7 would take some heat off the iPhone X too. After consideration, Apple decided to remove the headphone jack from the iPhone 7, as expected they received widespread criticism from customer and competitors. Although, companies like Google and Samsung would eventually follow suit. </p>
    <h3>Is It Courageous?</h3>
    <p>When Phil Schiller announced the removal of the headphone jack from the iPhone 7, he said they did it because of "courage", "the courage to move on". But clearly, it isn't because of courage. </p>
    <p>The courage is being able to buy their $160 AirPods and telling your wife that you did. That is courage. But seriously, it is courageous of them to remove such a worldwide standard, and trying to bring on a "wireless future". </p>
    <p>Apple received a lot of criticism, trying to remove the headphone jack, a wired connector. It can improve sound quality too, but at the same time Apple has other reasons for it too. By selling $160 AirPods, they earn more money by making people switch from their own wired headphones. </p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>It isn't because of "courage" to remove the headphone jack, but it's "courageous" to remove the headphone jack. Apple removed one of the worldwide standards from their own iPhones both so they could earn more money, and to increase sound quality and switch to a more "wireless" future. </p>
